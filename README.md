## Welcome to the vivaVideo project

**VivaVideo** is a base project to create your own C++ video-based OpenCV algorithms. 

Enclosed in this project you will find the **vivalib** framework.
The **vivaVideo** project uses the concurrent **vivalib** framework
 to process video or image sequences and generate video outputs of your algorithm. 
 
 
The **vivalib** framework uses the C++11 multithreading support to process video or image sequences in parallel. 
 The framework implements multithreading in a transparent way for the user, this allows the user to focus only in the computer vision task.

 
For more detailed information reefer to the project's  [wiki](https://github.com/asolis/vivaVideo/wiki).
